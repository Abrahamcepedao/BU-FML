####   LECTURE 1 CODE EXAMPLES #####
#This file introduces basic data types and logical operators in R
#numeric data types: integer, double

#Character
"my string"
#logical
TRUE
FALSE
#Arithmetic Operators work as in other programming languages
42 + 1 * 2 ^ 4
#Order of operations is preserved
( (42 + 1) * 2 )^4
# Logical Operators and comparison
# | is element-wise OR, & is element-wise AND
c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE) | c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE) & c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
#vs. single element OR ||, and AND && - only uses first element
c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE) || c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE) && c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
# Greater than and less than as you'd expect
1 + 7 > 7
## && and || just compare single truth values
1 + 7 >= 7 && 6 > 7
1 + 7 >= 7 || 6 > 7
###Testing for Equality
3 == 3
##Testing for Inequality
3 != 3
### VECTORS AND VARIABLES ####
#This file introduces saving values to variables and storing multiple values in a vector
###Variable assignment is <- OR =
##See here for more information on the difference:
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6140694/is-there-a-technical-difference-between-and
#Create a numeric variable
my_number = 483
my_number <- 483
###Default to double
typeof(my_number)
###Convert from double to integer
my_int = as.integer(my_number)
###typeof(my_int)
typeof(my_int)
#These different data types are not important when using R
# Since R will convert integers to doubles when needed automatically
# The only time these are important is when passing data to
# an external routine - written in C for example
###Vector data structure
my_vec <- c(1,2,67,-8)
typeof(my_vec)
#Can hold different variables
my_vec <- c(1,2,67,-8,"goat")
typeof(my_vec)
#Get some properties
my_vec <- c(1,2,67,-8)
str(my_vec)
###INDICES START AT 1 IN R
###Slicing and Dicing
#This returns the first element of the vector
my_vec[1]
#Vector indices start at 1 in R so this returns an empty element
my_vec[0]
#You can also pass in multiple indices as a vector
c(2:4)
my_vec[c(2,3)]
my_vec[c(2:4)]
#What does an out of bounds element return?
my_vec[5]
#This syntax assigns new elements to specified locations of the vector
#Note what happens to indices without an element
my_vec[5] = 41.2
my_vec[7] = 33
my_vec
my_vec[6]
##Keep every element of the vector except the 6th entry
my_vec = my_vec[-6]
my_vec
#Everything except the first two entries
my_vec = my_vec[c(-1,-2)]
my_vec
#Can save the indices as a variable before using for slicing
indices = c(2:4)
indices
my_vec[indices]
#What if we remove the character string?
my_vec <- c(1,2,67,-8,"goat")
my_vec = my_vec[1:4]
#Still characters unless converted
typeof(my_vec)
#Conversion to numeric
my_vec = as.numeric(my_vec)
typeof(my_vec)
#Can't convert non-numeric characters to numeric
my_vec <- c(1,2,67,-8,"goat")
my_vec = as.numeric(my_vec)
my_vec

### INSTALLING PACKAGES ####
###Installs the package from the CRAN mirror (must be connected to the internet)
#Only install the package if we don't already have it installed
if(!require(swirl))
{
install.packages("swirl")
}
if(!require(reader))
{
install.packages("reader")
}
#Library loads the specified package
library(reader)
###Loads the package to be used!
library(swirl)
### To see all installed packages
library()
###Quits out of R and asks if you want to save your workspace
q()
